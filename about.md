> Growing up, the idea of a career as a software engineer was a foreign concept.. but I'd always felt that my future would be digital somehow. I'd just have to crack life's Konami code

**I'm a React Developer.** In my day-to-day I've nurtured a fairly solid process for building and shipping some dope components that'll get the job done, and in my downtime I'm raising some wonderful kids and channeling my energy into building bridges not barriers. That requires stepping out of my comfort zone and creating this blog.

### Why blog?

I've long been toying with the idea of a space where all of my thoughts could exist alongside my code learnings - so here we are. This blog is an open space to share ideas, leave constructive comments, and potentially collaborate on some new challenges. This is my voice, but more importantly, I'd like for this to contribute to a larger conversation.

The best place to catch me is on the socials because well.. this is a blog and I rarely check emails, but I like for options to be available so feel free to connect with me by email if that's how you get down ðŸ’¯
