> Growing up, the idea of a career as a software engineer was a foreign concept.. but being around my grandfather's Tandy 1000 may have been slight foreshadowing that my future would be digital

**I'm primarily a React Developer** with some additional skills. In my day-to-day I'm building and shipping some dope components and services that'll get the job done, and in my downtime I'm raising some pretty cool kids and channeling my energy into building bridges not barriers. And a part of that building process requires stepping out of my comfort zone and creating this blog - so here we are.

### Why blog?

I've long been toying with the idea of a space where all of my thoughts and life lessons could exist in the same space as all that I've been learning about in the tech industry. So it made sense to create this blog as an open space to share ideas, leave constructive comments, and potentially collaborate on some new challenges. It's a space for my voice, but more importantly, I'd like for this space to contribute to much larger conversations

### Who are you?

_"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together"_

I'm a frontend engineer with goals of becoming full-stack. I'm a father, and a husband to a really chill wife. I get down with Javascript, React, NextJs, and a little Jekyll and Rails. I'm curious about software architecture like docker, k8s, and the like but admittedly haven't done enough dabbling to-date. And I'm a fan of a solid process. I've had many roles in my travels and found that teamwork really does make the dream work - I'm all about working together to reach goals. And AFK.. I enjoy browsing the eli5s and TILs to learn new things, watching a documentary or a good series, reading articles and listening to podcasts, and spending time outdoors with family and good friends ‚úåüèæ
