> Growing up, the idea of a career as a software engineer was a foreign concept.. but I'd always felt that my future would be digital somehow. I'd just have to crack life's Konami code

**I'm a React Developer.** In my day-to-day I've created a fairly solid process for building and shipping some dope components that'll get the job done, and in my downtime I'm raising some pretty cool kids and channeling my energy into building bridges not barriers. And a part of that building process requires stepping out of my comfort zone and creating this blog - so here we are.

### Why blog?

I've long been toying with the idea of a space where all of my thoughts and life lessons could exist in the same bit-driven universe as all that I've been learning about the industry. This blog is an open space to share ideas, leave constructive comments, and potentially collaborate on some new challenges. It's a space for my voice, but more importantly, I'd like for this to contribute to a larger conversation ðŸ’¯

### Who are you?

I'm an all things frontend engineer with all of the hopes and dreams of evolving into full-stack. I get down with Javascript, React, Angular, and a byte of Rails. I'm AI/ML curious, but admittedly haven't done enough dabbling to-date. And I'm a fan of a solid process - knowing where to go is important, but having a solid path is critical. I've had many roles in my travels and found that the most important attribute in all of them is teamwork. Outside of code.. reading, learning, documentaries, and my family and friends bring me joy. **Welcome**
