I recently submitted a PR and some constructive feedback led me down a rabbit hole of finding this method that had been hiding in plain sight.

## What were you up to?

I'd been looking for a way to separate a list of emails into two buckets, valid and invalid, so that I can log out the invalid emails and present that to the user. It'd already been a challenge because I'm working in Rails, but that just meant that I'm going to have to add some javascripty looking ruby code üòà


```ruby
# the heavy-handed operation I wrote looked something like this
valid = []
invalid = []

valid = emails.map {|email| validator.is_valid(email)}
invalid = emails.map {|email| !email.is_valid(email)}
```

But lo - and as I'd hoped, a patron saint of code feedback teammate of mine came through with some constructive feedback that ~~I could have used a year ago~~ changed everything.

## What was ['the way'][the way]?

Enter ruby's built-in partition method. It returns two arrays - the first containing the elements that return true and the second returns the rest üî• It made my day and now my method looks like: 

```ruby
valid, invalid = emails.partition {|email| validator.is_valid(email)}
```

So the next logical step is to ask myself, "does javascript have this?"

## Well, does Javascript have it?

The answer as of June, in the year of our Lord 2021 is **not out of the box**. But fortunately for me, our project is using lodash and sure enough, `_.partition` exists! [Lodash partition][lodash partition] behaves similar to the built-in ruby version, but with a slightly different syntax:

```javascript
// syntax
_.partition(collection, predicate)
```
It accepts two parameters. The **collection** to iterate over and the **predicate** which is the function to be invoked per iteration. Then it returns an array of grouped elements:

```javascript
// example from above where 'emailValidator' returns a bool
let [ valid, invalid ] = _.partition(emails, emailValidator(email))
```

_Just to note, I'm destructuring the arrays into separate buckets here for the purposes of my example._ 

And that's it! I've found a new tool to add to the toolbox, that I look forward to using much more of in the future. Have you used the partition method for something interesting? Let me know your thoughts and it might show up on the "B-side" of this article. And as always, I'm open to feedback so drop a line if you're feeling chatty and I'll try my best to respond ‚úåüèæ
