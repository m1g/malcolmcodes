That's right, I want all the smoke. I've got three reasons why after a long day of writing lengthy logic on my Macbook Pro for work, I come home to the peaceful clickety-clack of my Windows gaming laptop.

### 1. It's Affordable

I scooped up a version of [this bad boy][windows_laptop] refurbished for only \$450 from Best Buy. The internet connection is kind of weak, but I'm sure there's some upgrade that I haven't installed or some adapter that I'd need to buy to improve the performance. All things considered, for the size of the screen and to be able to do the basics + some simple gaming - it's perfect. After hacking away at some side projects, I can launch Steam, break out the Xbox controller and play Halo. Seamless

It's one of the top reasons I've always enjoyed buying PC's. After a purchase I still feel bold enough to order takeout.. might even buy some new kicks.

### 2. VsCode is üßày Smooth

There's something about the smooth, buttery scroll of holding backspace in VsCode that hits a little different on a Windows PC. And the tabs feel more responsive. TBH, I can't really put my finger on all of the specifics but it's a pleasure to code in. Even though setting up my environment was a little challenging, with a few quirks installing npm, rails and webpack, there's just something about the experience that feels speedy and natural.

I should mention that I'm also using [Git for Windows][git] and in every way possible trying to get the MacOS workflow that I'm used to so that writing code doesn't feel that awkward.

### 3. It's Customizable

I'm going to miss Microsoft's [brick and mortar locations][ms_stores_closing]. It was a great way to ask questions about my laptop since upgrades are a thing. I'm still not completely sure what the NVIDIA GeForce Experience does, but I have it - and it always wants to install drivers. And even though my internet connection is much slower on the PC, I'm sure that I'm just missing some drivers or an adapter that can speed it up. I'll plug in via an ethernet cable when I need a strong signal, otherwise loading a page can be a task even when I'm right next to the router.

In all, nothing beats being able to upgrade my device over time. I'll take picking up a few parts to get better performance over waiting a few years for a new, pricey release any day.

_I'm happy switching worlds, it keeps me on my toes - but what are your thoughts? Apple loyalists, have you cracked open a Microsoft Window and are ashamed to admit that the cool, refresing breeze was nice? Let me know your thoughts and it might show up on the "B-side" of this article. And as always, I'm open to feedback so drop a line if you're feeling chatty and I'll try my best to respond_ ‚úåüèæ
