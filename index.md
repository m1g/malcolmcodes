I'm a [1x engineer](https://1x.engineer/). A husband. A father of two cool kids. An ameliorist. A chill guy. And a whole bunch of other things and this blog is where worlds collide. Where I'll be discussing what I'm learning, a few tutorials here and there and my life experiences in general. Every now and then, if there's enough discussion, I'll have a [b-side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-side_and_B-side) to an article with feedback from you, the readers ðŸ‘“, to dive deeper into an article. Let's share, learn, and collaborate together ðŸ’¯
